## Features
 
The project boasts several key features:

* WELCOME MESSAGE AND CHECKING FILE TO UPDATE

![Welcome message](static/images/screenshot-start.png)

Welcomes the user when the app is opened. It checks all files and get the last file for data update. The name of the file to be updated appears underneath so the user knows what file to update, which is, the current month.

* NEW WORKSHEET

![Create new worksheet](static/images/screenshot-create-new-worksheet.png)

If the app detects that there is no file to update when user opens the app (meaning last file is already calculated and tallied), it asks the user to create a new worksheet before starting to work.

* MAIN MENU

![Working options](static/images/screenshot-main-menu.png)

There are different options in the main menu of the app:

- Add data to update file
- Tally, calculate and update worksheets
- View worksheets data
- Exit

* ADD DATA

![To update file with new data](static/images/screenshot-update-file.png)

To enter new data to update current month worksheet:

      - data should be separated with comma, no spaces.
      - Patient name can have spaces.
      - Use only the tests keywords to update file

An example is shown to guide the user.

* TALLY, CALCULATE AND UPDATE WORKSHEET

![Tally and calculate](static/images/screenshot-tally.png)

When tally option is selected, a message is prompted to the user reminding that the worksheet will not be accessible for new data and a new worksheet will be created.

This feature includes:

      - Appending "CLOSED" text into the worksheet as a sign that the worksheet is tallied and closed
      - Gets all the patients tests and tally them
      -  Calculates the amount value of each tallied tests to get the revenue
      - Updates the worksheets to save all gathered data and the calculated revenue

* VIEW DATA FROM WORKSHEET

## Testing
 
[Pep8online](http://pep8online.com/) is used to check code for validation to make sure there are no errors of bugs.

Mnaual testing was done during the development of the application. The terminal is used for testing before pushing to branch to see there's no error in the code.

Tested all new data is saved to the worksheet, new worksheet is accessible when app is running. Tested all the calculations and update each worksheet.

Tested deployed app to make sure all functions are working well and no error or bugs.
