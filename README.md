## Features
 
The project boasts several key features:

* WELCOME MESSAGE AND CHECKING FILE TO UPDATE

![Welcome message](static/images/screenshot-start.png)

Welcomes the user when the app is opened. It checks all files and get the last file for data update. The name of the file to be updated appears underneath so the user knows what file to update, which is, the current month.

* NEW WORKSHEET

![...add screenshot!!!...](static/images/screenshot.png)

If the app detects that there is no file to update when user opens the app (meaning last file is already calculated and tallied), it asks the user to create a new worksheet before starting to work.
